# The XYtextile

### Transforming textiles into an intuitive way to interact with computers. This project is part of an electronic textiles research on HCI gesture interaction that was started in 2005.

## About the project
The XYtextile is a large tactile interface use to play electronic music.
The performer plays it simply by the movement of his/her hand on it's surface.
This textile interface allows users to compose and interpret electronic music by choreographic movements.
By its size, its texture, its flexibility and its transparency, this textile interface involves the whole body in the musical interpretation.
Like a music score, the sound elements are graphically represented on the fabric, giving to the composer the ability to locate and play with them.
Thus, for each piece of music, a graphic partition is carried out.
The idea behind this project is also to develop an opposite approach to a classical process (from graphic towards the sound).
Created in collaboration with graphic designers and composers, these hybrid textiles offer spaces to be explored by look, touch and gesture.
Today, this multi-functional project inspires new usages in numerous domains.
For example, we're currently working with a choreographer to integrate dance with the XYtextile.
We already have created an installation which allowed people to communicate by drawings on the fabric over an internet connection.
We also plan to use this programmable surface for gesture recognition.
The idea is to associate symbolic gestures with a function: for example, to make an ambient light glow, you need to draw a circle on the fabric placed on a room wall.

Within the research project "ENIGMES" on the topic of navigable score, Marco Marini was taken part in the creation of a new XYtextile audio and graphic composition.
Actualy Marco uses this interface to do musical graphic notations and live performances.
Marco play The fabric as an instrument, facing the public through the translucent fabric he manipulate the sound as a physical material and act like a dancer.

## Hardware
This smart textile is made out of two conductive fabrics, each one containing conductive lines oriented in opposite directions.
When a pressure is apply on this structure, the two fabrics connect and the electronic sens the touch position.

## Firmware
To get the XY coordinates the firmware perform a two time sensing algorithm.
Eatch sequence sens a value that cotrespond to X or Y finger position.
This principle can be illustrated by the following schematics:

##Â Software
This library contains a set of programs that can be combined to fit any graphic pattern composition.
The code used for that project is mainly Pure Data.
This library is a fork of the ENIGMES-Lib (Max-MSP) made by Roland Cahen for the ENIGMES project.
